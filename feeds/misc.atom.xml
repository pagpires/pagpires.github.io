The pelican theme &lt;a href="http://oncrashreboot.com/elegant-best-pelican-theme-features"&gt;'elegant'&lt;/a&gt; partially satisfied my needs but I was not quite happy with the font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I saw Edward Tufte published the &lt;a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/"&gt;'Tufte CSS'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across those famous ET's books when I was a 2nd-year grad student. My PI always emphasized to us the importance of effective scientific communication. Therefore unsurprisingly we had all kinds of ET's books on data visualization as well as some others' work on scientific writing. I read his books and started to know a research field/discipline called data visualization and became more and more interested in it. Also, I really liked the styling in his books, the simplicity, the carefully chosen typography and the famous 'no more than 3 levels of headings'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I changed some of the font-family in 'elegant' to those 'tufte fonts'. You basically go to your blog and inspect-element on the writings with those fonts you don't like, and then search for these fonts in base.html file in your theme folder and replace them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tweaks to set up 'elegant' theme:
1. Plugins
This theme support a search bar, which requires plugin &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/tipue_search"&gt;'tipue_search'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/sitemap"&gt;'sitemap'&lt;/a&gt;. You need to download 'tipue_search' and 'sitemap' plugins and specify them in your pelican configuration file.
2. Template pages
By default this theme creates additional static pages like 404.html and search.html. You need to specify them by adding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEMPLATE_PAGES = {
'themePATH/elegant/templates/404.html': '404.html',
'themePATH/elegant/templates/search.html': 'search.html',
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into your configuation file.
3. links 'undefined' 
If you see all the search results are associated with 'undefined' links, check this &lt;a href="https://github.com/talha131/pelican-elegant/issues/147"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; . The easiest hack is to edit tipue_search.py and add &lt;code&gt;'loc': page_url&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;node =&lt;/code&gt; dicts in both &lt;code&gt;def create_tpage_node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;def create_json_node&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="practice"></category></entry><entry><title>It's just a curve</title><link href="https://pagpires.github.io/its-just-a-curve.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Xinyu Hong</name></author><id>tag:pagpires.github.io,2016-08-12:its-just-a-curve.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After trying different tools for my blogging system, I eventually settled with &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;pelican&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;github page&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are my reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Markdown&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need a system to write easily. WordPress and Markdown are my choices however Markdown has a better geeky flavor. More importantly, I will integrate the interactive data visualization into the webpage. WordPress can do this with some plugins however it doesn't support JSON to be upload, therefore I would have to upload my data source in my server while uploading the CSS and JS script to WordPress, which is annoying. After I saw this &lt;a href="http://www.nicksuch.com/2014/03/26/d3-sample/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, it became very natural that Markdown is &lt;em&gt;the choice&lt;/em&gt; to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Pelican&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing Markdown for blogging I will need a tool to generate static web pages. Since I plan to write some data analysis reports and to record my progress in &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; every once a while, I will often use ipython notebook and integrate it into my blog. Then &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a python-based tool for generating static web pages, seems to serve that role, especially after I saw this &lt;a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for setting up a data science blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;GitHub&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing GitHub is just to add some more geeky flavor to this blog. This might also force me to be familiar with project version control, which is an essential skill to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically that's how I ended up with these three gadgets for my blogging system. Either in terms of proficiency of these three tools, or in terms of skillfulness in the data science field that I'm going to cover in this blog, I'm both a newbie. However, for a systematically trained scientist-to-be like me, nothing can be hard after some dedicated time and efforts. It's just a learning curve, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry></feed>
